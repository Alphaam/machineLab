### LOST AT SEA

My goal is to create a scene representing someone(or something?) being lost at sea. The final outcome is meant to resemble a music box where there are pieces revolving around a central piece. The viewable output will consits of two parts:

1. A set of waves moving in, preferably, opposite directions.
2. A stationary central piece that the waves reviolve around. This central piece will contain a figure that I am yet to decide on.

## MATERIALS
I intend on building the waves and olatforms and their enclosure as well as the gears out of cardboard and the rest of the pieces out of wood similar to the initial construction assignment for this class.

## MECHANISM
I would like to create both circular and up and down motion of the waves. I aim to achieve both motions by creating gears with uneven radiuses. I am still investigating how to make two sets of waves move in opposite circular directions.

## CONCERNS

I still do not know how to make these waves move in opposite directions with an internal setup that is simple.
