## A brief description of your experience

I had a lot of fun constructing this mechanism. It was interesting to see how imperfect the interactions were. Nothing depended on anything fitting perfectly in place or sliding eactly into position. Instead, everything felt clumsy but functional. I am grateful tohave experienced this since it has de-mystified physical prototyping for me and made it feel approacheable.

## discuss 2-3 things that went wrong and what you did to overcome them

Nothing really went wrong with my constructiona. I made sure to look out for all the common causes of malfunction that the professor worned us about including the lenths of the cardboard pieces and how securely attached the pieces were to each other. By observing these things, I constructed my prototype without any issues.
