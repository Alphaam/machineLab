 I chose to focus on Jennifer's work because of her reliance on simple, non-translated movements with minimal parts to create seemingly complex visual effects. As I am learning how to not over-use technology/implement technology only as necessary in my endevour to become a more sustainable creative, I wanted to learn more about how she creates beauty so simply.

The projects I highlight in both my essay and presentation are ones that most inspired my final project piece as well as ones that I felt I learnt from most about her process and decided aestthetic.
